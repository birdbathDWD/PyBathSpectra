## About PyBathSpectra
### Contents
The *PyBathSpectra* repository contains Python code and example files for multimodal postprocessing of Doppler spectra recorded with DWD's operational German C-band radar (vertically pointing) birdbath scan, as described by Gergely et al. (2022, 2024).

All postprocessing methods are included in the `pybathspectra` package. The postprocessing routine for a birdbath scan can be executed by running 'postprocessing.py' with the desired postprocessing settings that are specified in 'postprocessing_config.yaml'. The 'input' folder is a collection of birdbath-scan example data, 'output' collects all numerical results and plots for visualizing the different steps of the postprocessing chain.
